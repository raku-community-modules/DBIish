=head1 DESCRIPTION
The name C<DBIish> has two meanings.  In lowercase it indicates the
github project being used for development.  In mixed case it is the
module name and class name that database client applications should use.

=head1 DBIish CLASSES and ROLES

=head2 DBIish
The C<DBIish> class exists mainly to provide the F<connect> method,
which acts as a constructor for database connections.

=head2 DBDish
The C<DBDish> role should only be used with 'does' to provide standard
members for DBDish classes.
